# Traffic-Simulation
 
A traffic flow simulation using a microscopic model called Intelligent-Driver Model, implemented using Python with the Pygame module. The article for the explanation of the modelling process is described on my article:

# Todo

- Make the drivers more "random" and has a wider variety of driver behaviour.
- Create a method for the drivers to change lanes.
- Crash physics and better collision detection algorithm.
- Include buttons to control simulation parameters from the program directly.
